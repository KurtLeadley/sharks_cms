					<li>Please try to keep the "Page Title" somewhat short</li>
					<li>The "Author Alias" can be changed, it will still count as an article for your user ID.</li>
					<li>Always enter an image for "Front Page Image". Place the image URL in the text field without quotes</li>
					<li>Please crop the front page images to be around 300px in height</li>
					<li>"Description" will be used to give a sneak peak into an article on the main page</li>
					<li>Most HTML tags are supported in the "Page Content" text field.</li>
					<li>Please start the Page Content with a brief 1 sentence Summary. Otherwise, the page structure of the archive and home page may be compromised. After that, images,tables,paragraphs,gifs, whatever the hell you want can be used.</li>
